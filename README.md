## Introduction
What is landing page in HTML?
Landing pages are designed to capture specific streams of traffic — a subset of your website visitors targeted by your marketing campaign. For example, if you've created a full-featured mobile fitness application that includes a monthly fee, your landing page might offer a free trial period for interested users.
